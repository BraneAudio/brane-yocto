Brane Audio Yocto Layers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This contains the Yocto layers for Brane Audio.

It is intended to provide one a way to build packages the same way that the Brane
Audio code does.

Probably the easiest way to build the packages is to start from the brane-oss repo
and follow its instructions.  That will build an image with all of the packages
in the same way that Brane Audio does.  It will grab the correct revisions of the
other layers that Brane Audio uses to work with these layers.

For information specific to a given layer consult the README at the top of that layer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For images built using these layers, they might include or exclude some files in the
image itself that is different than what Brane distributes, but the packages should
have been built how Brane Audio did (as long as the same versions of the other layers
are used and no other changes to files or extra layers are included).

For instance, in the real image distributed by Brane Audio there are no GPL3 items in
it, but other images built by others using this layer might have some just due to how
they are created.
