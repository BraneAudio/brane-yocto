Brane Audio Yocto Layer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This layer provides support for Brane Audio OSS for use with Yocto.

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
URI: git://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded
URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-freescale (This has its own licensing
      requirements depending on which recipes you use.  Brane Audio was not using
      any of those when this note was written, and everything being used should
      be under normal open source licensing.)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Licensing Notes:

Brane Audio authored files in this layer are MIT licensed.  (See COPYING.MIT)

Some files in this layer have a different license due to where we grabbed them
from (i.e. we grab linux firmware files and put them into a folder for the linux
kernel, since we build them into the kernel).  Those files have the license in the
same folder.

There are recipes in this layer from time to time that are copied from other layers
(usually because there is a later version of some package that was wanted but did
not have a recipe in the version of Yocto everything else was using at the time).
Those recipes would still fall under the licenses of the original layer.  A list
of those recipes and their licensing should be maintained below.

Other Layer Licensing:

Poky Layer Licensing (per LICENSE file at top directory of layer):
  Different components of OpenEmbedded are under different licenses (a mix
  of MIT and GPLv2). See COPYING.GPL-2.0-only and COPYING.MIT for further 
  details of the individual licenses.

  All metadata is MIT licensed unless otherwise stated. Source code
  included in tree for individual recipes (e.g. patches) are under 
  the LICENSE stated in the associated recipe (.bb file) unless 
  otherwise stated.

  License information for any other files is either explicitly stated 
  or defaults to GPL version 2 only.

  Individual files contain the following style tags instead of the full license 
  text to identify their license:

      SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only
      SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

  This enables machine processing of license information based on the SPDX
  License Identifiers that are here available: http://spdx.org/licenses/
